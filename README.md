# unliving-halloween

Halloween motion detecting picture frame/video player.  Motion is detected via the gpiozero library and using a GPIO-attached motion detection chip on the Raspberry Pi.

There are six videos, purchased through AtmosFX.  Each one also uses the transition effect from AtmosFX at the end and then pauses on the start of the next video.

I roughly used [this tutorial from Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-Pi-Based-Living-Portrait-Player-Intro/), and made it my own.
